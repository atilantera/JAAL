# JAAL - JSON-based Algorithm Animation Language

## Visual summary

![JAAL recording of an algorithm simulation exercise.](examples/jaal2html-example.png)

Figure above: JAAL recording of an algorithm simulation exercise of Prim's
algorithm. The graph with circular nodes A-N is the problem instance for
the exercise. Student simulates the execution steps of Prim's minimum
spanning tree algorithm by clicking the edges in order the algorithms adds
them to the spanning tree. Clicked edges appear yellow with bolder line.
The figure shows student's two first steps: add edges AB, and BF.

The figure above is a human-readable HTML conversion of a JAAL recording.
JAAL records student's steps in two ways. First, there is **semantics**: which
edge is clicked and when. Second, there is **graphics**, which are snapshots
of student's view of the exercise as they are solving it.

## Introduction

**What** | The JSON-based Algorithm Animation Language (JAAL) is a data format
for representing students' solutions to algorithm visualization exercises.
In practice, it has been designed to record students' answers to interactive
exercises made with the [JSAV framework](http://jsav.io) that are included in
[OpenDSA electronic textbook](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/) . JAAL has a
formal specification in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

**Why** | JAAL is intended to support [learning analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics) for
[algorithm visualization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1821996.1821997).

*Algorithm visualization* (or visual algorithm simulation) exercises are 
computerized exercises to teach data structures and algorithms at 
university-level computing education. An algorithm visualization exercise
displays the student a data structure, like an array containing integers. The
student interacts with the visualization by changing the state of the data
structure, e.g. clicking array elements to swap their values. This way the
student simulates the steps of an algorithm, e.g. insertion sort.

*Learning analytics* means collecting data on students' actions in an
electronic learning environment for students and instructors to understand
learning. JAAL has two use cases. First, after a student has 
attempted to solve an algorithm visualization exercise, they could compare
their solution steps to the model answer to verify in which steps they
succeeded. Second, a course instructor or a researcher may study
students' incorrect solutions to an exercise to understand the mistakes
that students often make. This analysis supports improving the learning 
material and finding misconceptions related to a particular topic.

A *formal specification* of JSON Schema has several benefits. The **software
developer** of an algorithm visualization exercise recorder can rely on a 
clearly defined specification on how to represent certain data structures 
and events. Thus, the specification facilitates adding recording support 
for many different kinds of algorithm visualization exercises.
Correspondingly, the software developer of an algorithm visualization 
exercise player can refer to the specification for reading JAAL data; this 
is very explicit compared to a situation of having just a reference program 
code for writing the data. Similarly, the specification helps a **researcher**
who writes their own software to [analyze a large quantity of students' 
solutions](#misconceptions). Finally, data following a JSON Schema 
can be
[automatically validated](https://json-schema.org/implementations#validators)
to support **data exchange** between different software systems.

For more information, see the section [Publications](#publications).

**This git repository**

This repository contains technical documentation, specification and examples
for JAAL. See the section  [Software](#software) for software which reads
and writes JAAL.

## Overview of schema

This section gives an overview of JAAL 2.0 JSON Schema structure along with
basic design principles of JAAL. The text aims to be understandable without 
an extensive understanding of JSON Schema.

![SVG image of schema](doc/versions/2.0/JAAL-2.0-schema.svg)

The figure above is a top-level map of JAAL 2.0 JSON Schema. Each
yellow box with titles such as **initialState**, **animation**, e.g. are 
*subschemas*. The box with title **JAAL** is the top level schema.
Each subschema has *properties* (key-value pairs). The **JAAL** schema has
the property `metadata` which has a *JSON Schema reference* to subschema
**metadata**. In other words, it means that a JSON object of type **JAAL**
has a key `metadata` whose value is a JSON object of type **metadata**.

The subschema **metadata** itself has properties such as `jaalVersion` and
`browser`. These may be numbers or string values. The `exercise` property
of the **metadata** subschema is a dictionary itself with keys `name`,
`collection`, and `runningLocation`. This is called a *nested property* in
JSON Schema.

The **initialState** subschema contains data structures represented in
algorithm visualization exercises. A detail omitted in the figure above is 
that the only property of **initialState**, `dataStructures`, is actually a 
list of data structures. Each data structure must have the format of one of
the subschemas **node**, **graph**, or **matrix**.

The `animation` property of **JAAL** schema is a list of **event**-type
objects. The **event** subschema represents student's actions: clicking
an object in a visualized data structure, or clicking an Undo button in an
exercise GUI. The property `object` describes which part of the visualization
was related to the event; it is one of the data structure schemas
**node**, **edge**, **graph**, **keyvalue**, or **matrix**.

Note that the arrow line from the `object` property of **event** is dashed.
This means it is a *JAAL id reference*. Each JAAL data structure schema
has  an `id` property which is a string. The *value* of the `object` property
is the same as the `id` property of an instance of **node**, **edge**,
**graph**, **keyvalue**, or **matrix**. This way the instances of subschemas 
can refer to each other without having to nest them, as this would produce 
redundant data. Thus, a **JAAL** `initialState` property *contains* 
data structures, but a **JAAL** `animation` **event**s *refer* to the data
structures in the aforementioned `initialState`.

The JAAL 2.0 JSON Schema has five data structure schemas. The most atomic
data structure subschema is **node** which may either a graph node or a cell
in an array or matrix. Subschema **matrix** represents both one- and
two-dimensional arrays.

The subschema **graph** represents all kinds of linked,
expandable data structures: lists, trees, and graphs. Each graph contains a
set of **node**s and a set of **edge**s. Each edge is a pair of nodes.
Because directed graphs may have some bidirectional edges, it is conventional
to define separately the set of nodes and then refer to them by their `id`
properties in edges; this is why the `node` property of the **edge**
subschema is a JAAL ID reference and not a JSON Schema reference.

## Data Examples

See the subdirectory [spec/test/valid/](spec/test/valid/) for examples of
data for each JAAL subschema, and for combinations of subschemas. The
examples contain different data structures typically occurring in algorithm 
visualization, for example:
- [linked list](spec/test/valid/graph-linkedlist-bidirectional.json)
- [binary search tree](spec/test/valid/graph-binary-search-tree.json)
- [red-black tree](spec/test/valid/graph-red-black-tree.json)
- [weighted graph](spec/test/valid/graph-undirected-weighted.json)
- [directed graph](spec/test/valid/graph-directed.json)
- [array](spec/test/valid/matrix-1d-vertical.json)
- [2D array](spec/test/valid/matrix-2d.json)

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for a real example on JAAL
data recorded from a JSAV exercise using [JSAV Exercise Recorder](https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/jsav-exercise-recorder).


## Specification

The current version for JAAL is 2.0.

JAAL 2.0 has a formal specification in
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
The JSON Schema for JAAL is in the subdirectory `spec`. See the
[README](spec/README.md) there.

JAAL 1.0 has no formal specification; it is implicitly specified by its
model implementation.
